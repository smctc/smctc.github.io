I am an Assistant Professor in Chemistry at Assam University, Silchar, specializing in theoretical and computational chemistry.  
With a Ph.D. from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, my research spans quantum chemistry, molecular modeling, hydrogen storage materials, and hostâ€“guest chemistry.  
I have held prestigious postdoctoral positions in India and Mexico, and have been recognized with awards such as the UGC-BSR Research Start-Up Grant and SERB National Postdoctoral Fellowship.  
Over the years, I have published extensively in reputed journals, contributed to multiple book chapters, and served as a reviewer and editorial board member for leading chemistry journals.
